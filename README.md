# Volume Control App

A Flutter application that provides a clean and modern interface for controlling device volume.

This application serves as a practical example of how to implement a volume control app using the volume_controller package.

My phone volume buttons are broken so I built this app to control my phone's volume using a slider. I hope it can help others too. ðŸ˜Š
